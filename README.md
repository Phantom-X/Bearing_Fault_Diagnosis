# Bearing_Fault_Diagnosis

I personally think that PhantomCNN has a very good network structure. I really hope that researchers will fork this project, 
further improve the network structure, and promote the development of data-driven bearing fault diagnosis methods. 
If you think this project is good, I hope you will give it a Star. Thank you! 
If you have any questions or suggestions, please go to issues to ask. (Please do not directly apply PhantomCNN to business or your own papers. Respect the originality.)
