# Bearing_Fault_Diagnosis

PhantomCNN is the algorithm of my graduation thesis, which was proposed in 2024. 
I personally think that PhantomCNN has a very good network structure. 
I really hope that researchers will fork this project and further improve the network structure to promote the development of data-driven bearing fault diagnosis methods. 
If you think this project is good, I hope you will give it a Star. Thank you! 
If you have any questions or suggestions, please go to issues to ask. (Please do not directly apply PhantomCNN to business or your own papers, respect the originality)
